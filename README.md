🧠 AI Medical Chatbot

This is an experimental AI-powered **Medical Chatbot** built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture. It uses **LangChain**, **FAISS**, **Mistral (via Hugging Face)**, and **Streamlit** to provide intelligent answers from medical documents.

> ⚠️ This chatbot is for learning purposes only and not intended for real medical advice.



 📌 About the Project

I started this project by following a YouTube tutorial to learn about:
- RAG pipelines
- LangChain integrations
- Hugging Face model usage
- Medical document processing
- Streamlit for UI

While I didn’t know much about RAG, Mistral, or Hugging Face initially, I’ve completed around **70% of the functionality**. The remaining 30% still needs debugging and learning — but I'm making consistent progress.
